This plugin for TiddlyWiki 2.x makes loading and saving work via just one file picking per session
(making experience much closer to the good old days than download saving).

Unlike the core "download saving", it allows you to save like this:

1. On the first saving attempt, it asks to pick the file (the TW itself);
2. It then asks to confirm the write file access;
3. Then it saves, and during the session (until the tab or the browser is reloaded), it saves without further interactions.
